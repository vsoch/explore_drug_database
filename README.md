# Pet project: explore french's drug data

The objective of this [pet projet](http://blog.jom.link/data_science_pet_project.html) is to explore the official French's drug database. This database is freely available on the [government website](http://base-donnees-publique.medicaments.gouv.fr/telechargement.php). 

# Techniques to apply

On this project, I only want to explore this database and produce some markdown reports. Package I want to practice are the mains ones from tidyverse:

- [tidyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr)
- [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr)
- [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)
- [rmarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown)

# Steps

1. Import the data
2. Save as Rda
3. Produce some reports
