```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Aim

Make some clustering on the database using kmeans

# Implementation

Import the only database I imported properly.

```{r}
db <- readRDS(file = "raw_rds/bdpm.rds")
```

Find some numerical variables

```{r}
str(db)
```

Not any usable in this database. Let's try another one.

In fact, after reading the data decription, there is almmost no numeric data. This dataset is not a good candidate for kmeans experiments.
